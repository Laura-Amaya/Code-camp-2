*This is my my first commit in GitHub.*

I am using my first Markdown document (**Peng video**). 

Let's load some data. 

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Here's a pairs plot of the data. 
```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on some predictors. 

```{r}
fit <- lm(Ozone~Solar.R +Wind +Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```
